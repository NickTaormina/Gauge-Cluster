# Gauge-Cluster
A QT-based gauge cluster for 15+ WRXs with a Cobb tuned ECU.

Only tested on a 2018 usdm using cobb v361-based map.

-Requires a tactrix cable atm. Direct can connection will be implemented later (see: https://github.com/NickTaormina/ESP32-CAN)

-Lg la123 or similar. Its a 12.3" 1920x720 display used in oem digital clusters. I got a vdisplay version from amazon that came with a controller board.

------Planned features------

-linux compatitbility

-logging

-real time fuel economy

-shfit light

-multiple gauge layouts

-navigation

-music 

-dtc 

-on the fly map switching with connection to tgv

*i've never used c++ or qt before, so everything is very sloppy*
